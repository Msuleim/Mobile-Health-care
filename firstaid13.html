        <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
        <p>Before starting the resuscitation process, make sure that the place and the injured are safe; it is also advisable to put gloves on the hands to prevent infection and diseases from being infected to the therapist or vice versa.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
        <p>Initially you should try to communicate with the injured verbally. If not, it should be twisted into the trapezius muscle (both sides of the neck) and rubbed the breastbone. If he does not respond, the patient is considered unconscious.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
        <p>Examination or foreign body inside the mouth of the paient should be examined. If present, the injured person head should be tilted to one side, the mouth discharged from the discharge with a finger, and any foreign object removed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
        <p>Hold the paient head from the area below the chin and from the forehead, and tilt it slightly backwards, in order to make sure the breath is opened.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
        <p>Check if the patient is breathing, by placing his hand on the chest area and rounding the ear out of the airway (mouth and nose). If there is no breathing, artificial respiration should be performed twice from the mouth, maintaining full adhesion between the patient mouth and the mouth of the ambulance provider.</p>

        <P><strong>Step 6</strong></P>
        <P>You should make sure that you have a pulse by pressing lightly on the side of the neck, where the carotid artery is located.</P>
        <img src="../cpr/step6.png" alt="cpr" style="width: 70px; height: 70;">
        <p><strong>Step 7</strong></p>
        <p>If we cannot feel a pulse, the first aid provider should perform thirty chest rubs (per minute), which are performed by bringing the hands together, stretching the elbows completely and applying pressure to the patient chest, using the full weight of the elbows (without folding the elbows).</p>
        <img src="../cpr/step7.png" alt="cpr" style="width: 70px; height: 70;">
        <p><strong>Step 8</strong></p>
        <p>A minute later, the condition of the patient must be assessed again and the pulse or breathing returned. In the absence of pulse or breathing, previous operations should be performed again.</p>
